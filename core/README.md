## humanity-core

*humanity-core* is a submodule of the *humanity* project in which only abstract classes and common interfaces are contained.  Any logical code is not permitted in this package.

To reiterate, humanity-core is *not* intended for any code that has influence on connection, or game-state.  Only code that does not strictly belong to either the server or client, but both (i.e., shared definitions, obscure factory methods, etc) belong in this module.

For any other questions, please open an [issue](https://github.com/humanity/humanity/issues).
